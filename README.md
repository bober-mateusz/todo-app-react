This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

- First, ensure you're node version is right using `node -v`, currently this project uses v18.16.0.

- The project uses `.nvmrc`, meaning if you have NVM you can run `nvm use` in the project directory to switch node versions easily.

```
todo-app % nvm use

Found 'Desktop/todo-app-main/todo-app/.nvmrc' with version <v18.16.0>
Now using node v18.16.0 (npm v9.5.1)
```

```bash
npm install
# Then one of the following :
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
